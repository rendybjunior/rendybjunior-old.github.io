Once upon a time, my manager introduced me a tool to help me manage the team. I was so green, this was the first time I manage a team so any tool will likely help me.

The tool is called OKR, stands for Objective and Key Result. There was not really much introduction done, so I did my homework trying to understand what this is about.

I found one article that helps me to understand OKR. I said to myself "This is no brainer, I'll just do it, it's super simple".

Then I drafted my first OKR. Two years passed. I felt very few benefit I get from OKR, it's just like simple goal and target setting, with a necessary buzzword to make it viral.

Recently I re-learn OKR, reading a book titled "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr, and here is what I learned.

#1. focus
#2. transparency
#3. track, track, track
#4. stretch
